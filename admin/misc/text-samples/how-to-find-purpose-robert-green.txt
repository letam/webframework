how to find your purpose in life:
THE PROBLEM - WHY WE'RE LOST
- being human is hard because nobody gives us direction
- you wake up not knowing what to do, could choose 12 different paths
- when you find your life's task, everything has purpose and energy is concentrated
- it's like having internal radar that guides you
- distractions become easy to cut out
YOUR UNIQUENESS IS YOUR POWER
- your DNA and life experience are completely unique, never repeated in history
- wasting that uniqueness is the worst thing you can do
- the power is finding what makes you YOU and mining that deeply
THE FIVE FRAMES OF MIND
- your brain naturally veers towards one type of intelligence:
• words and language
• abstract patterns and mathematics
• kinetic (body-based)
• social intelligence
• spatial intelligence
- go with that grain because that's where your power lies
CHILDHOOD SIGNALS - THE IMPULSE VOICES
- at age 4-5, you had voices saying "I love this, I hate that"
- these indicated your natural direction
- Robert Greene: obsessed with words at 6, spelling backwards, palindromes
- Einstein: mesmerized by compass, obsessed with invisible forces
- Steve Jobs: hypnotized by technological device designs
- Tiger Woods: screaming with joy watching golf
WHY WE LOSE THE SIGNAL
- at age 7+, other voices drown out your own (teachers, parents, peers)
- you enter work world without internal radar, making choices based on money
- you're not emotionally connected
EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT = FASTER LEARNING
- when emotionally engaged, brain learns 2-4x faster
- you feel it in your body, it's visceral not intellectual
- it's like swimming with current, everything clicks
- there's delight even through tedium

This guy literally breaks down how to find your life's purpose.
