Verse 1
Pali: “Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā; manasā ce paduṭṭhena, bhāsati vā karoti vā; tato naṃ dukkhamanveti, cakkaṃ'va vahato padaṃ.” 
Translation: "Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the hoof of the ox".
