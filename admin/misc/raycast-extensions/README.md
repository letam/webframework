## Configuration Options

### Script Parameters

The script accepts three parameters:

1. **body** (required): The body content for the post
2. **head** (optional): The title or headline for the post  
3. **open_url** (optional): Whether to open the created post in browser
   - `"1"`, `"o"`, or `"y"`: Opens the post URL in your default browser
   - `"0"` (default): Only displays the URL without opening it

### Environment Variables

You can customize the following variables in the script:

- `WEB_APP_URL`: The base URL of your web application
- `MAX_TEXT_LENGTH`: Maximum allowed text length (default: 1000)

### Customization

The script includes several customizable features:

1. **Colors**: Remove color codes if you prefer plain text output
2. **Browser Opening**: Control whether to open created posts in browser via the `open_url` parameter
3. **Error Messages**: Customize error messages and validation rules
4. **Parameter Validation**: Input validation for all parameters including the new `open_url` option

## API Requirements

This extension requires your web application to have:

1. A REST API endpoint at `/api/posts/` that accepts POST requests
2. JSON request format: `{"body": "your text content"}`
3. JSON response format with an `id` field for the created post
4. HTTP 201 status code for successful creation

## Error Handling

The script handles various error scenarios:

- ‚ùå No text provided
- ‚ùå Text too long (exceeds character limit)
- ‚ùå Server not running or unreachable
- ‚ùå API errors (invalid response, server errors)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create post (HTTP 000)"**
   - Check if your web application server is running
   - Verify the `WEB_APP_URL` is correct

2. **"No text provided"**
   - Make sure you're passing text as an argument to the script
   - Check Raycast configuration

3. **"Text too long"**
   - Reduce the text length or increase `MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` in the script

### Debug Mode

To debug issues, you can run the script directly from the terminal:

```bash
./capture-text.sh "Your test text here"
```

This will show detailed output including HTTP status codes and response bodies.

## Development

### Testing

Test the script with various scenarios:

```bash
# Test with valid input
./capture-text.sh "Valid test post"

# Test with no input
./capture-text.sh

# Test with long input
./capture-text.sh "$(printf 'a%.0s' {1..1001})"

# Test with server down
# (stop your web server first)
./capture-text.sh "Test with server down"
```

### Modifications

To modify the script:

1. Edit `capture-text.sh`
2. Test your changes
3. Update Raycast to use the modified script

## Security Considerations

- The script sends data over HTTP/HTTPS to your web application
- Ensure your web application has proper authentication if needed
- Consider using HTTPS in production environments
- Validate input on both client and server sides
